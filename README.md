# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! While having a portfolio website isn’t absolutely necessary, I believe it’s a great way to showcase your projects and skills. This repository contains the source code for my portfolio website, built with React (using Vite) and a few other modern technologies.

If you're interested in checking out the code to boost your own skills, feel free to explore and even use it as a starting point for your own projects.
